In each folder there is a slightly modified version for each OS

You will need to install pyperclip and pyautogui

You can do this by using


pip install pyperclip

pip install pyautogui

Explain:

You have 5 seconds to go onto the app you want to use -Works best on messages(mac) and whatsapp(mac/windows/linux)- this can be customised.
You then input your lyrics or text into the code between the speech marks.
It then loops over each word, copying and pasting it with an interval of 0.1 seconds- this can also be customised.

ATTENTION MAC USERS: You may be asked for permisson in system preferences, you need to enable this so it is allowed to work.
